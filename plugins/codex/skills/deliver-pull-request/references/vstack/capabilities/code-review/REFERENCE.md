## Contract

- Input: Base, candidate, scope, acceptance criteria, environment, constraints, complete diff, callers, tests, and configuration.
- Output: Ranked actionable findings, reviewed perspectives, exclusions, limitations, and next checks.
- Effects: Read-only review. It does not edit, approve, merge, publish, or submit an external review.

### Acceptance

- Findings bind to the exact base, candidate, and reviewed scope.
- Checked perspectives and material exclusions are explicit.
- Every required finding is actionable and evidence-backed.
- A no-finding conclusion names reviewed scope, exclusions, and remaining risk.

## Procedure

1. Set the base, candidate, scope, acceptance criteria, environment, and constraints. Read consumer rules, the complete diff, relevant callers, tests, and configuration.
2. Map changed entry points through contracts, state, consumers, and external effects. Assess applicable security, correctness, reliability, performance/cost, maintainability, developer experience, observability, and delivery.
3. Investigate supported boundaries, denial, retry, timeout, cancellation, concurrency, and recovery. Separate demonstrated defects, supported risks, and unanswered questions.
4. Deduplicate and rank findings. Each required finding includes location, scenario, evidence, impact, smallest repair, and verification.
5. Return material risks, uncertainties, and current evidence to the caller's quality validation. When standalone, return coverage gaps and the next check. Re-review only affected findings for new candidate or evidence; a bounded review can complete without target-code repair.

## Pitfalls

- A passing test outside the changed contract does not clear a finding; bind the test, base, candidate, and scenario.
- Absence of findings is not approval; report exclusions and remaining risk.
